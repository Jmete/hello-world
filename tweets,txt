a team getting to skip a play-off round when they won an identical number of games to a team who went out makes no sense.


@SirScoots sadly got slept on since kids nowadays need the whole joke spelling out


H2H is pure bullshit as a tie-breaker.


Standard mentally ill bullshit I get on a regular basis.


Reminder that in this format in CS no team who skipped to the semis ever won the tournament.  G2 looking to break the curse.


As if we went back from GSL system to garbage tie-breaker rules for 3-4 teams.

FNATIC were one of the most strictly nuke resistant teams in the whole scene. This is their 2nd ever game of the rework offline.

The way NBA fans talked about the last NBA finals for the last year you'd legit think Warriors had lost 0:4 with no suspensions.


@dupreehCSGO I think FaZe and G2 could legit win maps off top 10 teams using solely low econ force-buys and no gun rounds.
